When you have already burned the Arch Linux ISO to the USB drive, modifying the ISO itself can be a bit more complex and may require additional steps. If you want to include your custom script in the bootable environment without modifying the ISO directly, you can follow these steps:

    Mount the ISO:
        On a Linux system, you can use the loopback device to mount the ISO as follows:

        bash

    sudo mount -o loop /path/to/arch-linux.iso /mnt/iso

Copy the Script:

    Copy your custom Python script to the mounted ISO directory. For example:

    bash

    sudo cp /path/to/your_script.py /mnt/iso/

Modify Boot Configuration (Optional):

    Some bootable ISOs, like the Arch Linux ISO, use isolinux or syslinux as the bootloader. You might be able to modify the bootloader configuration to execute your script during the boot process.
    Locate the isolinux or syslinux configuration files on the ISO. These files might be named isolinux.cfg, syslinux.cfg, or similar.
    Edit the configuration file to add a boot entry that specifies the path to your script. This could look something like:

    css

    label custom_script
        menu label Run Custom Script
        kernel /path/to/your_script.py

Unmount the ISO:

    After making the necessary changes, unmount the ISO:

    bash

        sudo umount /mnt/iso

    Test the Bootable USB:
        Insert the USB drive into a computer and boot from it.
        Select the custom boot entry you added (if applicable) and see if your script runs.

Please note that modifying bootable ISOs and bootloader configurations requires a good understanding of the boot process and the specific bootloader being used. Be cautious and test thoroughly before using this in a production environment. If you're not comfortable with these steps, consider using the previous method of creating a custom bootable USB drive with your script included from the start.
